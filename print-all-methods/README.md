# K2's CC Repo / Print All Methods
## Usage:
This program works both advanced and normal computers and monitors. <br>
<br>
By default the program expects a monitor to the right of the computer and the peripheral to be tested on top of it. These can be changed with the first 2 lines of the file.<br>
<br>
Place the computer and monitors and then run the program, once a peripheral is placed on top it will print all its methods line by line on the monitor. <br>
<br>
There is currently no line overrun feature so if the peripheral has more methods than monitor lines or the peripheral name is wider than monitor then you will need to add more monitors.
